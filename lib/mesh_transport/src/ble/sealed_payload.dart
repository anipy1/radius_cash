/// The bytes inside a session used to be raw UTF-8, which was fine while chat
/// text was the only thing anyone sent. Reusing the Noise session for the
/// internet transport changed that: a peer has to be told our Nostr address,
/// and it has to arrive somewhere an attacker cannot forge. Inside the session
/// is the only such place, because only the real peer can seal to it.
///
///   [kind:1][body]
///
/// One byte, because this sits inside a channel that is already authenticated
/// and length delimited. There is nothing to validate here beyond the kind, and
/// an unknown kind is skipped rather than shown, on the same reasoning as the
/// outer frame: a peer running a newer build should not turn into visible
/// nonsense on an older one.
