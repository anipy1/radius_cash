/// Nostr is secp256k1 and Noise is X25519, which is why this cannot simply
/// reuse the mesh key. Two curves, two keys, one seed:
///
///   seed --HKDF "sign"--> Ed25519    : signs things on the mesh
///   seed --HKDF "noise"-> X25519     : the static key Noise XX authenticates
///   seed --HKDF "nostr"-> secp256k1  : this, for the internet transport
///
/// Because it comes from the seed, restoring the seed restores the npub too.
/// There is no separate Nostr backup to lose, and adding this changed nothing
/// about the two keys derived before it: the info strings keep them apart.
