///
///   seed --HKDF "sign"--> Ed25519  : signs things, the root identity

///
/// bitchat converts its Ed25519 key into an X25519 key instead, with ed2curve.

/// something to do carefully rather than by default. Deriving two independent
/// keys from a common seed costs nothing here and avoids the question, and
/// HKDF's info string is exactly the tool for keeping them apart.
///
/// The Nostr secp256k1 key gets the same treatment when the internet transport
/// arrives. It is a third info string on the same seed, so adding it later does
